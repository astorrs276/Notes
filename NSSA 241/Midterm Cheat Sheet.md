 Thatâ€™s a solid list of networking topics! Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown to help you understand each one.

### **Networking Basics**
- **Network**: A network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and services.
- **Protocol**: A set of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received across a network (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP).
- **Standard**: A formally defined specification that ensures interoperability between devices and networks (e.g., IEEE, IETF, ISO standards).

### **OSI Model (7 Layers)**
1. **Physical**: Deals with hardware, cables, and signals.
2. **Data Link**: Responsible for MAC addressing and error detection.
3. **Network**: Manages IP addressing and routing.
4. **Transport**: Handles end-to-end communication (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session**: Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation**: Ensures data formatting and encryption.
7. **Application**: Interfaces with user applications (HTTP, FTP, DNS).

**Examples of Protocols at Each Layer:**

| OSI Layer    | Example Protocols          |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Application  | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP       |
| Presentation | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG        |
| Session      | NetBIOS, PPTP              |
| Transport    | TCP, UDP                   |
| Network      | IP, ICMP, ARP              |
| Data Link    | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP       |
| Physical     | Fiber, Copper, Radio Waves |

---

### **Networking Devices Per Layer**
| OSI Layer | Device                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 1 (Physical) | Hubs, Repeaters, Cables |
| 2 (Data Link) | Switches, Bridges |
| 3 (Network) | Routers |
| 4-7 (Higher Layers) | Firewalls, Load Balancers |

### **Addressing**
- **Why is addressing needed?**  
  - Ensures data reaches the correct destination.
- **MAC Address**: 48-bit address (6 bytes), written in hexadecimal (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).  
  - OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) is the first 3 bytes.
- **IP Packet**: Contains source/destination addresses, TTL, and data.
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Limits packet lifetime, decreases at each hop.
- **Source/Destination Address**: Identifies sender and receiver in IP communication.

---

### **IPv4 Addressing**
- **Length**: 32-bit (4 bytes).
- **Classes:**
  - **A**: `1.0.0.0 â€“ 126.255.255.255` (Large networks)
  - **B**: `128.0.0.0 â€“ 191.255.255.255` (Medium networks)
  - **C**: `192.0.0.0 â€“ 223.255.255.255` (Small networks)
  - **D**: `224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255` (Multicast)
  - **E**: `240.0.0.0 â€“ 255.255.255.255` (Reserved)

- **Special Cases:**
  - **Loopback**: `127.0.0.1` (Used for testing)
  - **Multicast**: `224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255`
  - **Broadcast**: `255.255.255.255` (All devices on a network)
  - **Private Addresses**:
    - Class A: `10.0.0.0/8`
    - Class B: `172.16.0.0/12`
    - Class C: `192.168.0.0/16`

---

### **Subnetting**
- Splitting a network into smaller sub-networks.
- **Example Calculation**:
  - Given `192.168.1.0/24`, subnet it into 4 equal subnets.
  - `/24` â†’ `255.255.255.0`
  - Need 4 subnets â†’ `Subnet mask = /26` (`255.255.255.192`)
  - **Subnet ranges**:
    - `192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63`
    - `192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127`
    - `192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191`
    - `192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255`

---

### **Routing**
- **Host Routing**: Directs packets to the correct destination based on a routing table.
- **Binary Math**: Used in subnetting and IP calculations.

**Example Routing Table Question:**

| Destination | Subnet Mask | Interface |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 192.168.1.0 | 255.255.255.0 | eth0 |
| 10.0.0.0 | 255.0.0.0 | eth1 |

Q: Where does `192.168.1.100` go?  
A: `eth0` (matches `192.168.1.0/24`)

### **Wireshark**
- Works at **Layer 2 (Data Link)** and above.
- Captures and analyzes network traffic.

---

### **Switches**
- **Purpose**: Connect devices in a LAN.
- **How it Works**: Uses MAC addresses to forward frames.
- **SAT (Switching Address Table)**: Stores MAC addresses and port mappings.

---

### **Routers**
- **Purpose**: Connects different networks.
- **How it Works**: Uses IP addresses to route packets.

---

### **Hubs (Obsolete)**
- **Function**: Broadcasts data to all connected devices.
- **Why Obsolete?** Inefficient, replaced by switches.

---

### **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
- **What it does**: Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- **How it works**:
  - ARP Request: "Who has 192.168.1.1?"
  - ARP Reply: "192.168.1.1 is at `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`."
- **Packet Format**:
  - Source MAC
  - Destination MAC
  - Opcode (Request/Reply)
  - Source/Destination IP
- **ARP Table**: Stores resolved addresses.

---

### **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
- Used for network diagnostics (e.g., `ping`).
- **ICMP Request**: "Are you there?"
- **ICMP Reply**: "Yes, I am."
- **ICMP TTL**: Used in traceroute.

---

### **Ethernet**
- **Definition**: Wired networking standard.
- **Protocol Standard**: IEEE 802.3.
- **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**:
  - Used in half-duplex Ethernet to avoid collisions.
- **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**:
  - Used in Wi-Fi networks.
