### Normative Differences
Each normative theory determines the basis of morality differently. What makes something morally right and wrong differs
Most of the time, all ethical theories are telling us the same thing
- All normative ethical theories tell us *murder is wrong*, but differ in telling us why it is wrong or what we should do in response
Cohesion is the uninteresting part. Disagreement is where we, as ethicists come into play
Normative theories tell us what we should do in response to moral problems
### Consequentialism
What makes an action morally right or morally wrong is the moral valence of the resulting consequences of an action
**Moral Valence** - the status of something as *morally good*, *morally bad*, *morally permissible*, or morally *impermissible*
You evaluate the consequences of an action OR evaluate the possible resulting consequences of a hypothetical action
Two key claims
- The moral valence of an action is determined by the resulting consequences
- An action is morally obligatory iff it maximizes the good
Evaluating consequences
- What do we use to evaluate if a set of consequences is morally good or bad?
- **Hedonic Consequentialism** - What defines the good are those things that bring about pleasure and prevent or diminish pain
- "To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure ... they designate as utterly mean and groveling, as a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurious were" (JSM, p. 10)
Greatest Happiness Principle
- Morally good action are defined as maximizing *utility* (idea of bringing about the best and most perfect form of happiness)
- "Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include \[those faculties] gratification"
### Utilitarianism
Key claims
- The moral valence of an action is determined by evaluating if the action brings about the consequence with the greatest utility
- An action maximizes the greatest utility if those actions define
