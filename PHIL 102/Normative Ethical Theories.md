### Normative Differences
Each normative theory determines the basis of morality differently. What makes something morally right and wrong differs
Most of the time, all ethical theories are telling us the same thing
- All normative ethical theories tell us *murder is wrong*, but differ in telling us why it is wrong or what we should do in response
Cohesion is the uninteresting part. Disagreement is where we, as ethicists come into play
Normative theories tell us what we should do in response to moral problems
### Consequentialism
What makes an action morally right or morally wrong is the moral valence of the resulting consequences of an action
**Moral Valence** - the status of something as *morally good*, *morally bad*, *morally permissible*, or morally *impermissible*
You evaluate the consequences of an action OR evaluate the possible resulting consequences of a hypothetical action
Two key claims
- The moral valence of an action is determined by the resulting consequences
- An action is morally obligatory iff it maximizes the good
Evaluating consequences
- What do we use to evaluate if a set of consequences is morally good or bad?
- **Hedonic Consequentialism** - What defines the good are those things that bring about pleasure and prevent or diminish pain
- "To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure ... they designate as utterly mean and groveling, as a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurious were" (JSM, p. 10)
Greatest Happiness Principle
- Morally good action are defined as maximizing *utility* (idea of bringing about the best and most perfect form of happiness)
- "Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include \[those faculties] gratification"
### Utilitarianism
Key claims
- The moral valence of an action is determined by evaluating if the action brings about the consequence with the greatest utility
- An action maximizes the greatest utility if those actions define
### Kantian Deontology
Immaneul Kant (1726-1804, PRU) - German Idealism
The Right Honourable The Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve (GBR, Ph.D Harvard under John Rawls, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge)
**Key principles**
- All rational agents have a "Good Will" which is out capacity to rationally understand the moral law that exists within reality. This *Good Will* must be trained and cultivated to have the correct responses to the moral in the world
- An action is wrong iff its maxim isn't universalizable
- Humans are rational agents that have the unique capacity to self-determine and that self-determination should not be infringed upon
**Deontology** - study or logos of duty
**Duty** - that which is required by the moral law
**Pure Practical Reason** - doing the right thing for the right reason in the right way
**Maxims** - intentional action statements that are to be evaluated
Supreme Principle of Morality
- The Categorical Imperative
3 Formulations
- Formula of Universal Law
	- Act only according to that maxim though which you can at the same time will that it will become a universal law
	- Self vs. Others & Perfect vs. Imperfect
		- Perfect - logical contradictions: "one must never \_\_\_"
		- Imperfect - personal preferences: "One must sometimes and to some extent \_\_\_"
- Formula of the End in Itself - O'Neill's focus
	- Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether it your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a mere means but always at the same time as an end
	- Mere means: only as transactional - "using someone is a scheme of action to which they could not in principle consent"
	- Ends in themselves: respect others as rational persons - "to act beneficially is to seek other's happiness, to intend to achieve some of the things that those others aim at with their maxims"
- Formula of the Kingdom of Ends
	- "act in accordance with the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely possible kingdom of ends"
	- it combines the others in that:
		- it requires that we conform our actions to the laws of an ideal moral legislature
		- that this legislature lays down universal laws, binding all rational wills including out own
		- that those laws are of "a merely possible kingdom" each of whose members equally possesses
Any maxim should either fail or pass all 3 of the formulas. if it passes 2 or 1 and fails the others, then either the maxim needs to be refined or you made a mistake in evaluating the maxim
