### How do we explain moral disagreement?
**Different views of the world**
- Radical Relativism - there is nothing that is true
- Ethical Relativism - there isn't an objective truth, but there are morally salient things that we can rationally agree upon
- Moral realism - there is an objective 
### Ethics vs. Morality
**Morality** - a value system that tells us about the rightness and wrongness of things, actions, and properties in the world
**Ethics** - a system we can use to evaluate the values of rightness and wrongness of things, actions, and properties in the world
**Normative Ethical Theories** - theories that provide (a) moral standard(s) to which we can evaluate things and actions in the world
- Ethics is not equivalent to the law
- It is not about what is reasonable or practical to do
**"Morals"** is banned - overused and not specific enough
### Normativity
Developing a standard of something to which other instances can be compared
**In Ethics** - developing a normative understanding of moral standards
"Don't confuse the descriptive claim with the normative claim" - Pizzaro
**Descriptive Claims**
**Competing descriptive claims** - equally plausible IFF (if and only if) both seem to explain the process of the phenomena
**Evaluating Descriptive Claims** - how to know what is correct?
- We need a normative standard by which to evaluate these competing claims
**Determining Normative Standards**
- learned standards vs natural standards
- what "sounds" right
### Moral Persuasion
**Changing moral beliefs and motivated reasoning**
"If a moral belief depends **centrally** on an issue or belief about the world that you then lose the belief, then you'd change the moral belief" (Sommers)
**Research methods**
- Hypothesis
- Devise a Test
- Collect Data
- Reach a Conclusion
- Support that Conclusion
**Argument**
- Supporting a claim that aims to reflect reality or justify an action - reason to believe or do something
- a proper argument should target motivation
- persuasion requires knowledge about human beliefs and psychology
- Basic, structured form of reasoning that uses premises to create conclusions
- Basic Syllogism
	1. Socrates is a man - identifies Socrates as a thing that can be understood in the general category of man
	2. All men are mortal - identifies the characteristic of man as being mortals
	3. Socrates is mortal - combines the above two statements to make a conclusion
- Validity
	- Evaluation of the logical form of an argument, where the conclusion must be true IFF the premises are true based on their logical structure
	- It does not mean *that's true!* or *I agree!*
- Soundness
	- Evaluation of a fact-value of the premises as accurately reflecting the world
	- Good arguments are both valid and sound
**"Valid"** is banned if used incorrectly
