### Why do we care about cybersecurity
**So much info is online**
- if anyone can access it, then there could be a lot of problems
- critical infrastructure is all online so companies and governments can be very vulnerable
- without cybersecurity, no one is safe since people can find anything that they want (I love OSINT)
**Laws and policies don't keep up with new technology**
**Technology keeps evolving**
- a lot of new benefits arise but so do a lot of risks
- with AI progression, people struggling to know what is real or not
**So many things that can't be done without technology**
- similar to the rise of electricity, we can't live without it
**Cyber attacks are not bounded by countries**
- can make laws and regulations a lot harder
### Issues
**We have an increasing reliance on information communication technologies**
**We rely on all the same technological solutions (Microsoft, Google, etc.) so small issues on their end can destroy everything**
**Most of our IT infrastructure is owned by private companies**

### What is the cyberspace
**What are some elements of the cyberspace**
- cyberspace isn't directly physical but has some elements that are - most notably the infrastructure that it runs on
- it isn't just the internet - includes servers, fiber optic cables, etc.
- also includes intangibles - data, software, network, internet, etc.
- "The cyber-space consists of artifacts based on or dependent on computing and communications technology; the information that these artifacts use, store, handle or process; and the interconnections among these various elements" (National Academy of Sciences, 2014)
- since we depend on the cyberspace, we want that information technologies operating in the cyberspace to do what they are supposed to do WHEN they are supposed to do it
### What is cybersecurity
**"Is the protection of information and its critical characteristics (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), including the systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit that information, through the application of policy, training, and awareness programs and technology" (Whitman, 2019)**
**Is non-exclusively a technical issue. Non-technological elements (psychological, organizational, political) influence cybersecurity**
