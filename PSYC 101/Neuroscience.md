Neuroscience - branch of life sciences studying the structure and function of the brain and nervous system
Overlaps a lot with psychology, but focuses more on the physical side of the brain and how it works
Heavy emphasis on bodily functions that may or may not be looked into by psychologists
Biological psychology or behavioral neuroscience - focus on biological bases of psychological processes
Nervous system - network of cells that carry informational to and from all parts of the body
Neuron
- Nerve cell
- Building block of the nervous system
- Function: send and receive messages to and from the body
- Glial Cells: other cells of nervous system
	- Provide structure and support for neurons
### Neural Communication
Electrochemical process
- Half of the process entails changes in electrical charges
- Half of the process entails chemical distribution (neurotransmitters)
Resting Potential - state of neuron when NOT firing a neural impulse
- Ions within and outside the cell
	- Inside cell - mostly negative charge (more - protein ions than + potassium ions)
	- Outside cell - mostly positive charge (more + sodium ions than - chloride ions)
- No flow because of the plasma membrane
- Difference in charges creates electrical potential - primes it for an electrical impulse
Neural Impulse
- Reverses electrical charge within axon
- Sodium channels in membrane briefly open
	- Allows + charged ions to enter axon
	- Channels close afterwards and pump + ions back out of the cell (return to resting potential)
- Travels down axon from soma to terminal branches
	- Chain reaction
Action potential
- Neuron receives excitatory ("Fire!") and inhibitory ("Don't fire!") signals from many neurons
- Action potential occurs when excitatory : inhibitory signal ration exceed a minimum intensity (threshold)
- All-or-None
	- Neuron fires completely or not at all
	- No "partial" firing of neurons
- Intensity of action potential
	- Remains same throughout length of axon
- Refractory Period
	- Brief waiting period after an action potential to allow neuron to rest
	- Neuron cannot fire during this period
Communication with other cells
- Impulse reaches terminal knobs
- Inside knobs: **synaptic vesicles** - contain **neurotransmitters** - chemical messengers
- Synapse - Small gap between knob and dendrite of next neuron
- Receptor sites on surface of receiving neuron
- Impulse causes vesicles to release neurotransmitters into synaptic gap
- Neurotransmitters bind to receptor sites of next cell - signals next cell
- Agonist
	- Mimics neurotransmitters and roughly fits in the same space to trick your cells
- Antagonist
	- Can't mimic neurotransmitters accurately but will fill the space and prevent other cells fitting in
### Nervous System
Central Nervous System
- Brain and spinal cord
Peripheral Nervous System
- All other nerves and neurons in the body
- 2 Systems
	- Somatic NS: controls voluntary muscles and movement
	- Autonomic NS: controls automatic functions (organs, glands, etc.)
		- Sympathetic ("fight or flight")
		- Parasympathetic ("rest and digest") divisions
### Central Nervous System
Spinal cord - long bundle of neurons
- Carries messages from brain to body
- Controls reflexes
Reflex Arc - connection between 3 types of neurons
- Afferent (sensory) - from senses to spinal cord
- Efferent (motor) - from spinal cord to muscles and glands
- Interneurons - connect the neurons
The brain
- Lesioning
	- Studying humans or animals with damage to parts of brain
- Stimulation
	- Invasive: electrodes in brain
	- Noninvasive: magnetic fields, scalp electrodes
- Studying the brain
	- Computer Tomography (CT scan) - series of x-rays aided by a computer
	- Electroencephalogram (EEG) - electrodes on scalp record electrical activity
	- Positron Emission Tomography (PET) - measures metabolism/energy consumption via trace amounts of radioactive ions (typically glucose)
	- Functional MRI (fMRI) - measures oxygen levels in blood via magnets
### Brain Structure
Bottom level: Hindbrain or Brainstem
- Where spinal cord widens and enters skull
- "Oldest" (in an evolutionary sense) part of the brain
- Controls basic survival functions
- Medulla
	- Basic survival functions (heartbeat, breathing, etc.)
- Pons
	- Coordinates left and right sides of the body and regulates sleep
- Reticular Formation
	- Controls arousal (sexual, physiological, etc.)
- Cerebellum
	- Regulates movements (voluntary and involuntary - balance)
Mid level: Limbic system
- Thalamus
	- Brain's sensory switchboard
- Hypothalamus
	- Maintenance activities (eating, drinking, body temp, etc.)
- Amygdala
	- Emotions like fear and anger
- Hippocampus
	- Memory (especially spatial and long-term memory)
Top level: Cerebrum and Cerebral Cortex
- Cerebrum (Forebrain)
	- Upper front part of the brain
- Cerebral Cortex
	- Outer part of the cerebrum
- Wrinkled (allows more cortical cells to exist within small space in the skull)
- 2 hemispheres - connected by corpus callosum
- Divided into 4 lobes
	- Occipital lobe
		- Vision and visual processing
	- Temporal lobe
		- Hearing and speech
		- Wernicke's area - area involved in understanding speech
			- Usually on the left side of the brain
	- Frontal lobe
		- Complex thinking, planning, etc.
		- Motor Cortex - strip of brain involved in voluntary movement
		- Broca's area - area involved in producing speech (or signed language)
	- Parietal lobe
		- Touch and perception
		- Somatosensory Cortex - strip of brain involved in receiving information from senses
