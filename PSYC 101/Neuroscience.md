Neuroscience - branch of life sciences studying the structure and function of the brain and nervous system
Overlaps a lot with psychology, but focuses more on the physical side of the brain and how it works
Heavy emphasis on bodily functions that may or may not be looked into by psychologists
Biological psychology or behavioral neuroscience - focus on biological bases of psychological processes
Nervous system - network of cells that carry informational to and from all parts of the body
Neuron
- Nerve cell
- Building block of the nervous system
- Function: send and receive messages to and from the body
- Glial Cells: other cells of nervous system
	- Provide structure and support for neurons
### Neural Communication
Electrochemical process
- Half of the process entails changes in electrical charges
- Half of the process entails chemical distribution (neurotransmitters)
Resting Potential - state of neuron when NOT firing a neural impulse
- Ions within and outside the cell
	- Inside cell - mostly negative charge (more - protein ions than + potassium ions)
	- Outside cell - mostly positive charge (more + sodium ions than - chloride ions)
- No flow because of the plasma membrane
- Difference in charges creates electrical potential - primes it for an electrical impulse
Neural Impluse
- Reverses electrical charge within axon
- Sodium channels in membrane briefly open
	- Allows + charged ions to enter axon
	- Channels close afterwards and pump + ions back out of the cell (return to resting potential)
- Travels down axon from soma to terminal branches
	- Chain reaction
Action potential
- Neuron receives excitatory ("Fire!") and inhibitory ("Don't fire!") signals from many neurons
- Action potential occurs when excitatory : inhibitory signal ration exceed a minimum intensity (threshold)
- All-or-None
	- Neuron fires completely or not at all
	- No "partial" firing of neurons
- Intensity of action potential
	- Remains same throughout length of axon
- Refractory Period
	- Brief waiting period after an action potential to allow neuron to rest
	- Neuron cannot fire during this period
