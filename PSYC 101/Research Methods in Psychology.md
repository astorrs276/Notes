### The Mozart Effect (Rauscher Et Al. - 1993)
**Studied College Students**
**3 Groups**
- 1 listened to a Mozart sonata
- 1 listened to verbal relaxation instructions
- 1 listened to silence
**Afterwards, Mozart has an 8-9 point increase on a test of spatial reasoning (from one section of the Stanford-Binet IQ test)**
- Did NOT measure intelligence!!
**Effect only lasted 15 minutes**
**There is an effect but not based on Mozart, it's based on mood**
**People listening to music with their kids does help - mainly because it ends up with them also singing to their kids, which helps more**
### How do psychologists ask and answer questions?
**Scientific Method: a way of asking and answering questions that follows a predetermined series of steps:**
1. Posing a question
	- Typically based on a *theory*: organized set of assumptions or principles that attempt to explain certain phenomena and how they are related
	- Ex: Does a student's method of note-taking (handwritten vs typed) influence their academic performance?
2. Conduct a literature review
	- Need to examine what research has already been done on the topic
	- Don't want to repeat other people's research unless there is new info to be found
3. Develop a *hypothesis*: a prediction, based on a theory, that can be tested
	- Needs to be precise
	- Ex: Students who hand-write their notes will receive higher grades than students who type their notes
4. Testing the hypothesis
	- Develop *operational definitions*: specific, measurable definition of a variable
	- Collect data
5. Analyze the data and draw conclusions
	- Was the hypothesis correct?
		- If yes, replicate. If no, why not? Repeat study? Change some part of it?
	- What is the next step for research? Future directions
**Other key parts of a study**
- Need to define who you want to study
	- Representative sample - group of participants that accurately represent the larger population of interest
	- Psychology: the study of the college undergraduate? - lots of studies use college students which isn't always going to well represent the population
