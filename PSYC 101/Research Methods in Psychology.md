### The Mozart Effect (Rauscher Et Al. - 1993)
**Studied College Students**
**3 Groups**
- 1 listened to a Mozart sonata
- 1 listened to verbal relaxation instructions
- 1 listened to silence
**Afterwards, Mozart has an 8-9 point increase on a test of spatial reasoning (from one section of the Stanford-Binet IQ test)**
- Did NOT measure intelligence!!
**Effect only lasted 15 minutes**
**There is an effect but not based on Mozart, it's based on mood**
**People listening to music with their kids does help - mainly because it ends up with them also singing to their kids, which helps more**
### How do psychologists ask and answer questions?
**Scientific Method: a way of asking and answering questions that follows a predetermined series of steps:**
1. Posing a question
	- Typically based on a *theory*: organized set of assumptions or principles that attempt to explain certain phenomena and how they are related
	- Ex: Does a student's method of note-taking (handwritten vs typed) influence their academic performance?
2. Conduct a literature review
	- Need to examine what research has already been done on the topic
	- Don't want to repeat other people's research unless there is new info to be found
3. Develop a *hypothesis*: a prediction, based on a theory, that can be tested
	- Needs to be precise
	- Ex: Students who hand-write their notes will receive higher grades than students who type their notes
4. Testing the hypothesis
	- Develop *operational definitions*: specific, measurable definition of a variable
	- Collect data
5. Analyze the data and draw conclusions
	- Was the hypothesis correct?
		- If yes, replicate. If no, why not? Repeat study? Change some part of it?
	- What is the next step for research? Future directions
**Other key parts of a study**
- Need to define who you want to study
	- Representative sample - group of participants that accurately represent the larger population of interest
	- Psychology: the study of the college undergraduate? - lots of studies use college students which isn't always going to well represent the population
### Types of Research
Descriptive Research - describes a characteristic of a population
- Ex: How many students hand-write notes in class? How many students type their notes?
Correlational Research - determines the relationship between two variables
- How changes in one variable influence the other variable
- Ex: Does changing the amount of hand-writing one's notes influence their grade?
Experimental Research - determines cause-and-effect relationship between variables
- Ex: Does hand-writing notes cause an increase in grades?
- Differences between groups can be caused by other things (ex: different amount of sleep) and experiments need to control those variables
### Descriptive Research Methods
Case Study
- Detailed description of a particular individual based on careful observation or formal psychological testing
- Can be very revealing, but run risk of making untrue assumptions or overgeneralizing
- Ex: Genie, Phineas Gage
- Can involve studying one off situations that people end up in
Observational Studies
- Research observes, measures, and records behavior
- Avoid intruding on the people/animals being studied
- Naturalistic vs Laboratory observation
	- More natural/realistic environment vs more controlled/regulated environment
Psychological Tests and Surveys
- Self-report methods via questionnaire, interview, etc.
- Quick and easy way to collect data, and typically reliable
- Problems: sampling issues, lying/misrepresentation, wording effects
### Correlational Research
Correlation - numerical measure of strength of relationship between two variables
Correlation Coefficient - numerical value that measures correlation
- Ranges from -1 to +1
- 0 = no association between variables
- Positive = as one goes up, other tends to go up
- Negative = as one goes up, other tends to go down
**CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION**
- Just because 2 variables are correlated does NOT mean one causes the other
- Ex: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are positively correlated
	- Should we ban all ice cream sales? Does eating ice cream cause drowning?
	- Eat ice cream at the beach, when younger, when it's warmer - all things that can increase risk of drowning
### Experimental Research Design
Only way to determine causality
Allows researcher to control or manipulate the situation being studied
- Do something to affect people's behavior and then watch what happens
Variable - characteristics of behavior or experience that can be measured or described by a numeric scale
Hypothesis - explicit prediction of results based on what's being studied
Independent variable
- Aspect of the experiment that is being manipulated or varied by the researcher
- Ex: form of writing notes (hand-writing/typing)
Dependent variable
- What researcher is trying to measure or predict
	- Reaction of subject to independent variable
- Ex: grades
### Experimental Control
Control Condition - participants treated exactly as experimental group, but not exposed to experimental treatment/manipulation
- Ex: Control group sits in class but takes no notes at all
Random Assignment - assigning people to experimental and control groups so each person has same probability as any other of being assigned to either group
- This is the *crucial* feature that allows us to determine causality
### Placebo Effect and Other Control Concerns
Placebo Effect - effect of expectations in experimental research rather than experimental manipulation
Single-Blind Study - participant doesn't know if they are in experimental or control group
Double-Blind Study - experimenter AND participant don't know which group the participant is in
Experimenter Effect - unintended changes in participant's actions based on information unintentionally given to them by the experimenter
### Research Ethics
Must respect participants' dignity and welfare
Participation must be voluntary
- Informed consent - participant must know enough about a study to make an intelligent, informed decision
Deception - must be justified by study's potential value
Debriefing - sit down and explain everything that happened and why it was asked of you
- Might be delayed until study concludes or happen when you complete your part
A lot of places have an approval board
- Determines if a study is ethical and will tell you whether you can do it
- If you're denied approval and still proceed there can be significant penalties
