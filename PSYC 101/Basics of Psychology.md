### Applied Psychology: Science Based Studying and Learning

**State-dependent learning**
- you learn and remember best if you're in a similar state to when you first learn information
- memories are based on associations
- if you can make an association with your current environment or mental state to the environment or mental state you were in when you learned the material, you can remember it a lot better
- this is a part of why cramming isn't always the most effective - your environment while cramming will rarely be similar to the environment of the test
**What you're thinking about while studying is key**
- if you keep your mind focused on the material you'll get in down more easily
- if your mind is wandering, you'll remember less
- different people have different things that work well for them
- any distractions, even very quick ones, can mess up your flow a ton
- ideally leave all distractions behind
- check in with yourself - see if you remember what you just reviewed
**Tackle avoidance**
- build a routine and a study space
    - helps to activate the state-dependent recall
    - helps to get you in the right mindset
    - build study times into your schedule - makes sure you have time and avoids cramming and freak outs because you're already prepared
- minimize distractions
	- keeping studying spaces for studying and fun spaces for fun puts you in the right mindset when you go to those spaces
	- improves focus and productivity
- chunk tasks
	- break up large tasks and assignments into smaller chunks
	- helps avoid getting overwhelmed
	- helps with preparation
	- prevents you having a massive amount of work to do all at once at the end
	- allows you to spend small amounts of free time making progress rather than wasting the time
	- helps build momentum by giving you the satisfaction of completing parts consistently

### What is Psychology?

- We still carry the ideals from the Humanistic Movement
- Facilitated by the advances in neuroscience
